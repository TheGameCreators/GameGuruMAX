Task Behaviors
A two part behavior set for requiring a object to complete the task.

There are two separate but related behaviors
1. The Task Object
The Task_Object behavior attaches to a selected object to be the recipient
of the required task tool to switch/activate other objects or zones.
Can be used with an animated object with "ON" named animation.
Set the behavior options:-
TASK TEXT: For text about task requirement
USE RANGE: For the use range
TOOL REQUIRED: Select the tool required to activate, either a preset or Named Tool
TOOL NAME: Name if a Named Tool is selected
TASK USE TEXT: Task to use text (when tool aquired)
TASK DONE TEXT: Task completed text
<Sound0> for the using tool sound
<Sound1> for the task complete sound

2. The Task Tool
The Task_Tool behavior attaches to any selected object to act as the
required task tool to activate the Task Object.
Set the behavior options:-
PROMPT TEXT: For the use prompt text
PICKUP RANGE: For the pickup range
AUTO PICKUP: Range pickup instead of E to pick up.
TOOL TYPE: Select the tool type, either a preset or Named Tool
TOOL NAME: Name if a Named Tool is selected
<Sound0> when picked up.

Link the Task Object with the logic connector to whatever you wish to activate.

The Task Object cannot operate until the Task Tool is possessed. If in possession of
a Task Tool and within range of the the Task Object then using the Task Object, the
Task Object will activate the linked object.
